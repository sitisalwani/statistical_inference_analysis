Now in the second portion of the project, we’re going to analyze the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.

(@) Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses
(@) Provide a basic summary of the data.
(@) Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even if there’s other approaches worth considering)
(@) State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.

Required package;
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

####1. Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data analyses

```{r}
# Load the data ToothGrowth
data(ToothGrowth)
# Look at the structure of the data
str(ToothGrowth)

```

####2. Provide a basic summary of the data.
```{r}
# Look at the summary of the data
summary(ToothGrowth)
```

```{r}
# Compare means of the different delivery methods
tapply(ToothGrowth$len,ToothGrowth$supp, mean)
```

```{r}
# Make a plot to look at data graphically
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(factor(dose), len, fill = factor(dose))) +
      geom_boxplot() +
      # facet_grid(.~supp)+
      facet_grid(.~supp, labeller = as_labeller(
            c("OJ" = "Orange juice", 
              "VC" = "Ascorbic Acid"))) +
      labs(x = "Dose in milligrams/day", 
           y = "Tooth Lengh") +
      scale_fill_discrete(name = "Dosage of\nvitamin C\nin mg/day") +
      ggtitle("Effect of Supplement Type and Dosage on Tooth Growth")
```
 
#### 3. Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose.
 
```{r}
# Comparison by delivery method for the same dosage
t05 <- t.test(len ~ supp, 
       data = rbind(ToothGrowth[(ToothGrowth$dose == 0.5) & 
                                      (ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ"),],
                    ToothGrowth[(ToothGrowth$dose == 0.5) & 
                                      (ToothGrowth$supp == "VC"),]), 
       var.equal = FALSE)

t1 <- t.test(len ~ supp, 
       data = rbind(ToothGrowth[(ToothGrowth$dose == 1) & 
                                      (ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ"),],
                    ToothGrowth[(ToothGrowth$dose == 1) & 
                                      (ToothGrowth$supp == "VC"),]), 
       var.equal = FALSE)

t2 <- t.test(len ~ supp, 
       data = rbind(ToothGrowth[(ToothGrowth$dose == 2) & 
                                      (ToothGrowth$supp == "OJ"),],
                    ToothGrowth[(ToothGrowth$dose == 2) & 
                                      (ToothGrowth$supp == "VC"),]), 
       var.equal = FALSE)

# Make summary of the conducted t.tests, which compare the delivery methods by dosage
# take p-values and CI
summaryBYsupp <- data.frame(
      "p-value" = c(t05$p.value, t1$p.value, t2$p.value),
      "Conf.Low" = c(t05$conf.int[1],t1$conf.int[1], t2$conf.int[1]),
      "Conf.High" = c(t05$conf.int[2],t1$conf.int[2], t2$conf.int[2]),
      row.names = c("Dosage .05","Dosage 1","Dosage 2"))
# Show the data table 
summaryBYsupp
```
 
#### 4.  State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your conclusions.
> With 95% confidence we reject the null hypothesis, stating that there is no difference in the tooth growth by the delivery method for .5 and 1 milligrams/day. We observe p-values less than the treshold of .05 and the confidence levels don’t include 0. So, for dosage of .5 milligrams/day and 1 milligrams/day does matter the delivery method. With 95% confidence we fail to reject the null hypothesis, stating that there is no difference in the tooth  growth by the delivery method for 2 milligrams/day. We observe p-values more than the treshold of .05 and the  confidence levels include 0. So, for dosage of 2 milligrams/day the delivery method doesn’t matter.
